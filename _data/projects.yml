- project: "Assessing Image Quality in Photoacoustic Imaging"
  role: "Master's Thesis Research"
  duration: "2024"
  url: "https://github.com/MellevdB/thesis_melle.git"
  description: "Developed a comprehensive framework for automatic image quality assessment in photoacoustic imaging (PAI). Evaluated full-reference and no-reference image quality metrics on diverse experimental and simulated datasets. Implemented deep learning models (PhotoacousticQualityNet, IQDCNN, EfficientNetIQA) to predict quality scores directly from reconstructed images. Found that structural metrics like SSIM, S3IM, and IWSSIM are most reliable for PAI quality assessment, while deep learning models achieved accurate predictions with EfficientNetIQA showing best performance. Conducted interpretability analysis and compared with expert preferences through surveys."

- project: "Encoding Expert Knowledge in Medical AI Applications"
  role: "Bachelor Thesis Research"
  duration: "2023"
  description: "Research project focused on training machines with symbolic constraints in medical AI applications. Explored methods to incorporate expert knowledge and domain-specific constraints into machine learning models for medical applications, ensuring that AI systems can leverage both data-driven insights and expert medical knowledge."

- project: "Interdisciplinary Research Project"
  role: "Thema 3, Beta Gamma"
  duration: "2022"
  description: "Interdisciplinary research project as part of the Beta Gamma program, combining insights from multiple scientific disciplines to address complex problems. Developed skills in connecting different fields and applying diverse methodologies to research questions."
