- project: "Assessing Image Quality in Photoacoustic Imaging"
  role: "Master's Thesis Research"
  duration: "2024"
  url: "https://github.com/MellevdB/thesis_melle.git"
  description: "Developed a comprehensive framework for automatic image quality assessment in photoacoustic imaging (PAI). Evaluated full-reference and no-reference image quality metrics on diverse experimental and simulated datasets. Implemented deep learning models (PhotoacousticQualityNet, IQDCNN, EfficientNetIQA) to predict quality scores directly from reconstructed images. Found that structural metrics like SSIM, S3IM, and IWSSIM are most reliable for PAI quality assessment, while deep learning models achieved accurate predictions with EfficientNetIQA showing best performance. Conducted interpretability analysis and compared with expert preferences through surveys."

- project: "Deep Learning for Medical Image Analysis"
  role: "Research Assistant"
  duration: "2023-2024"
  description: "Applied computer vision and deep learning techniques to medical imaging problems. Worked with PyTorch and TensorFlow for image classification, segmentation, and quality assessment tasks. Developed preprocessing pipelines and data augmentation strategies for medical datasets."

- project: "Reinforcement Learning Applications"
  role: "Course Projects"
  duration: "2023"
  description: "Implemented various reinforcement learning algorithms including policy gradients and Q-learning using OpenAI Gym environments. Developed custom environments and experimented with different exploration strategies and reward functions."
