My academic work includes a thesis on assessing image quality in photoacoustic imaging, combining both classic image quality metrics and modern deep learning approaches. I'm passionate about applying AI in versatile, real-world contexts where domain knowledge, technical skills, and creative thinking come together.</p>"
